**Project Title**

Comparative-study-of-machine-learning-algorithms-in-predicting-cervical-cancer.

**Project Overview**

Cervical cancer prediction models play a crucial role in early detection and personalized care. This project compares machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to assess their effectiveness in predicting cervical cancer. Using clinical and demographic data, the study will investigate how data preparation and feature selection impact model accuracy and reliability. The ultimate goal is to enhance screening and early diagnosis.

**Data Overview**

This project uses a dataset containing 858 records on cervical cancer risk factors collected in Venezuela between 2012 and 2013. The dataset includes demographic, medical, and behavioral features such as age, number of sexual partners, contraceptive use, and history of STDs. The target variable is a Biopsy result indicating the presence or absence of cervical cancer. Ethically sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the data has been preprocessed for quality and accuracy, ensuring compliance with privacy standards and suitability for research.

**Research Question**

To what extent can machine learning algorithms be effectively optimized and compared for the accurate 
prediction of cervical cancer, and how do these models perform in terms of explainability, sensitivity, and 
clinical relevance?

**Dependencies**

Install or use any Python IDE preferably Google Colab or Jupyter notebook.

Install any required Python library packages for EDA, Model Development, and Performance Evaluation.

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, keras, matplotlib, tensorflow.
