**Msc Data project thesis**

**Project Title**
Comparative-study-of-machine-learning-algorithms-in-predicting-cervical-cancer.

**Research Question**
To what extent can machine learning algorithms be effectively optimized and compared for the accurate 
prediction of cervical cancer, and how do these models perform in terms of explainability, sensitivity, and 
clinical relevance?

**Dependencies**

Install or use any Python IDE preferably Google Colab or Jupyter notebook.
Install any required Python library packages for EDA, Model Development, and Performance Evaluation, preferably using pip, pip install -r requirements.txt
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, keras, matplotlib, tensorflow, joblib.
